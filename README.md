### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Geert-Jan Zwiers, I'm a Dutch Software and DevOps Engineer who likes to work with web languages e.g. TypeScript, Rust and DevOps/Cloud tech e.g. Ansible, Azure Docker and Linux.

I was not always a software engineer, in fact I graduated in environmental science, but I've always had a keen interest in computer tech and with languages nonetheless. In my spare time I go hiking a lot and I like to play some piano. One day I hope to develop analytical software solutions to accelerate sustainability.
