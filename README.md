### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Geert-Jan (Gordon) Zwiers. I am a Dutch DevOps Engineer and currently work with the Azure platform, Ansible, Docker and Linux systems. I have also worked with Node.js, TypeScript, C# and Rust.

In my spare time I like to go on hikes in nature, I play the piano (just a little bit) and I try to keep fit by fencing.
