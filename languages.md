# Languages used in this Book

Statically typed languages favor performance while dynamically typed ones favor flexibility. Nowadays, there is much overlap between high-level languages in the sense that they provide constructs to allow developers to code in a more static or a more dynamic way. 


### JavaScript
The most used language on the web today, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In recent years it has evolved fast from small website scripting to full-fledged web apps, server-side solutions and even desktop applications.

### Python
The most popular language for learning to code as well as data science and analytics. It trades speed for readability.

### C#
A statically typed language firmly grounded in object-oriented programming style.

### Rust
A relatively new language designed for performance and security. It is syntactically more difficult than the others, but offers highly precise controls for memory management and multithreading.
